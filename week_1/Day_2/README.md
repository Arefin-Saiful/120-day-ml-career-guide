# Day 2 — Logic and Control Flow

## 🎯 Goals
* Understand boolean logic and control flow in Python
* Learn short-circuit evaluation
* Identify floating-point precision issues

## 🔨 Work Done
* Implemented guard clauses using short-circuit evaluation
* Demonstrated floating-point comparison pitfalls
* Practiced truthiness checks with empty collections
* Used conditional (ternary) expressions for concise logic

## 🧠 Key Learnings
* **Short-circuiting** prevents unsafe attribute access
* **Floating-point numbers** cannot always be compared directly
* **Python objects** have inherent truth values
* **Conditional expressions** evaluate to values, not control flow

## 🛑 Blockers / Questions
* None
